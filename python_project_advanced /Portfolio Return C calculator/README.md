It ask user the stock they own amount they invested in each and also makes them enter 5 months of return value in order to calculate covariance and correlation .
Its performs folliowng function after receiving these data:-
1.Calculate overall retrun of the stock
2.covariance matrix
3.correlation
4.portfolio risk (Note-before calculating this make sure you have calculated covariance matrix no-2 . though it also tell you to compute it first if you press 4 without calculating covariance.)
In this project numpy concept is used for caclculating covariance , correlation,portfoilio risk etc and also basic loops , ifelse, list and dictionary.
Thank You for reading this!!!! .I hope you have a great day.
